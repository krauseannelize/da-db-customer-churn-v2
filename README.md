## Project Overview

This is a guided case study by DataCamp:[Analyzing Customer Churn in Tableau](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/case-study-analyzing-customer-churn-in-tableau). I investigate a dataset for a telecom company Databel to analyze customer churn to figure out why customers are churning at the rate they are. The deliverable is a cohesive Tableau story containing the following dashboards with appropriate filters:

1. Overview
- KPIs for number of customers, number of churned customers, as well as the churn rate
- A bar graph showing the reasons customers churn
- A pie chart showing the churn by category
- A donut chart showing the customers by contract type
- A map visualization with the churn by stae
2. Age Brackets & Groups
- A histogram showing number of customers in each age brackets with the churn rate overlayed
- A column chart showing the number of customers in groups with the churn rate overlayed
3. Data & International Plan
- A column chart comparing data usage grouped into categories differentiate between customers on a data plan and those who are not
- Heatmap analyzing whether customers are on an international plan and actively calling internationally with the respective churn rate
- KPIs for number of customers, number of churned customers, total extra data charges, and total extra international charges
4. Payment Method & Contract Type
- Scatterplot analyzing churn rate against account length, payment methods and contract type
